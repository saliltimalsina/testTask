Certainly, I'll provide the network design without the cloud services component. Here's the revised network design description:

**Network Design:**

**Assumptions and Requirements:**
1. The company, a small manufacturing firm, has specific network requirements to support its operations.
2. The network must accommodate three distinct segments: Factory, Office, and Security Cameras.
3. IP addressing should adhere to the requirement of using student IDs (12230053 and 12236825) as the starting digits (53 and 25).
4. IPv4 addresses with /16 or /24 network masks will be employed.
5. Network security, scalability, and redundancy are key considerations.
6. The network includes an Internet Gateway Router to provide internet connectivity.

**Network Topology:**

The network topology is divided into three primary segments:

1. **Factory Segment:** This segment includes the machinery and control systems used in the manufacturing process. The Factory Router connects to various machines, some of which have wired LAN interfaces, while others use wireless WiFi connections. IP addresses in this segment start with "53."

2. **Office Segment:** The Office Router connects various departments, including Sales, Customer Support, Engineering, and Business Administration. Users in this segment use a mix of wired desktop computers and wireless devices. IP addresses in this segment start with "25."

3. **Security Cameras Segment:** Security cameras are deployed for monitoring both the exterior and interior of the facilities. The Security Camera Server stores and manages the video feed from these cameras. IP addresses in this segment also start with "25."

**Explanation of Key Design Decisions:**
- **Segmentation:** We have segmented the network to isolate different functional areas of the company, enhancing security and network management.
- **Student IDs as IP Prefix:** The use of student IDs in IP addresses provides a consistent and easily identifiable naming convention.
- **VLANs:** Virtual LANs (VLANs) are used to logically isolate and manage traffic within each segment.
- **Internet Gateway Router:** The Internet Gateway Router connects the company's network to the internet, enabling internet access for all segments while providing firewall security.
- **Redundancy:** Redundant switches and routers are used to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Security Monitoring:** Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) are implemented to monitor network traffic for any suspicious activity.

**Address Allocations:**

1. **Factory Subnet (53.0.0.0/16):**
   - DHCP Range: 53.0.0.1 to 53.0.0.254
   - Static IPs for critical machinery and devices.

2. **Office Subnet (25.0.0.0/24):**
   - DHCP Range: 25.0.0.1 to 25.0.0.254
   - Static IPs for servers and network devices.

3. **Security Cameras Subnet (25.1.0.0/24):**
   - DHCP Range: 25.1.0.1 to 25.1.0.254
   - Static IPs for the security camera servers.

**Recommended Hardware:**
- **Internet Gateway Router:** Cisco ASR 1000 Series
- **Core Switches:** Cisco Catalyst 9000 Series
- **Access Switches:** Cisco Catalyst 3000 Series
- **Routers:** Cisco ISR 4000 Series
- **Firewall:** Palo Alto Networks PA-Series
- **VPN Gateway:** Cisco ASA Firewall with AnyConnect
- **IDS/IPS:** Snort IDS/IPS

**Security Controls:**
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** ACLs are implemented on routers and switches to control and filter traffic between subnets, enhancing network security.
- **Regular Patching:** All network devices and servers undergo regular security patching to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA is enforced for accessing network resources, providing an additional layer of security.
- **Encryption:** Strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS) are employed for securing data in transit and at rest, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) continuously monitor network traffic, alerting administrators to potential threats or attacks.

This comprehensive network design caters to the company's requirements, combining security, scalability, redundancy, and efficient network management to support its manufacturing and administrative operations effectively. Please note that the cloud services component has been excluded as per your request.
